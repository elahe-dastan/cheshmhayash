# Contours
Contours are basically the boundaries of objects, the line or curve that joins the continuous points along the boundary
of an object. From mathematical point of view they are not the same as edges. Contours are useful tools when you get 
into shape analysis and object detection and recognition.

# Spaces
open cv reads BGR images and show them as BGR but matplot lib works with RGB images
